# Home-Automation-using-arduino-uno
Home Automation system achieved great popularity in the last few 
decades and it increases the comfort and quality of life. In this paper 
an emerging home automation system is discussed. Nowadays most 
home automation system consists of automated / pre-programmed 
devices.
The main objective of this project is to develop a home automation 
system using an Arduino board. As technology is advancing so houses 
are also getting smarter. Modern houses are gradually shifting from 
conventional switches to centralised control system, involving remote 
control switches.
Presently, conventional wall switches located at different parts of 
house makes it difficult for user to go near them and operate. Even 
more it becomes more difficult for the elderly and physically 
handicapped people to do so. Remote controlled home automation 
system provides a most modern solution with automatic switching 
system. The project uses an Arduino UNO as its main component.
Arduino was born at the Lvrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy 
tool for fast prototyping. arduino board are always changing and 
updating to new needs and challenges. All Arduino boards are 
empowering users to build on them independently and eventually 
adapt them to their particular needs. The software too, is opensource, and is growing through the contributions of users worldwide.
